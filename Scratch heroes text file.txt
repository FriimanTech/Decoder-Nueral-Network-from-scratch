
Superman, also known as the Man of Steel, is one of the most iconic superheroes of all time. Born on the planet Krypton, he was sent to Earth as an infant by his parents, Jor-El and Lara, to escape the imminent destruction of his home planet. His spacecraft crash-landed in the rural town of Smallville, Kansas, where he was discovered by Jonathan and Martha Kent, who adopted him and named him Clark.

As Clark Kent grew up, he began to discover his incredible powers, which were derived from Earth's yellow sun. These powers include superhuman strength, speed, flight, invulnerability, and various other abilities, such as heat vision, x-ray vision, and super breath. Despite his godlike abilities, Clark was raised with strong moral values by the Kents, instilling in him a deep sense of justice, responsibility, and compassion.

As an adult, Clark moved to Metropolis, where he took on the alter ego of Superman, dedicating his life to protecting humanity from all manner of threats. He also works as a journalist for the Daily Planet, using his civilian identity to stay connected to the people he swore to protect. Superman's greatest foes include Lex Luthor, his arch-nemesis, a brilliant but morally bankrupt businessman, and other supervillains like General Zod and Doomsday.

After years of training in various forms of combat, detective work, and the art of intimidation, Bruce Wayne returned to Gotham, assuming the identity of Batman.

Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, is one of the most beloved and relatable superheroes in comic book history. Peter was a nerdy, socially awkward high school student living in Queens, New York, when he was bitten by a radioactive spider during a science exhibit. The bite granted him spider-like abilities, including superhuman strength, agility, the ability to cling to walls, and a "spider-sense" that alerts him to danger.

Initially using his powers for personal gain, Peter's life was tragically changed when his beloved Uncle Ben was killed by a burglar that Peter had earlier ignored. This event taught him the invaluable lesson that "with great power comes great responsibility." Devastated by guilt, Peter vowed to use his powers to fight crime and protect the innocent, adopting the persona of Spider-Man.

Tony's life took a dramatic turn when he was captured by terrorists while demonstrating a new missile system in Afghanistan (or Vietnam in earlier versions).
